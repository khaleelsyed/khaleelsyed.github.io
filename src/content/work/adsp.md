At ADSP, I have been instrumental in designing, building, testing, and maintaining scalable data architectures. In collaboration with senior engineers, data scientists, and cross-functional teams, I have spearheaded efforts to identify data acquisition opportunities and developed integrated APIs and internal tools to streamline workflow efficiency. My work, primarily with Python, has leveraged frameworks such as Django, FastAPI, and Prisma to craft robust data solutions.

Additionally, I have automated data workflows to ensure optimal performance and reliability, implementing strategies that have greatly enhanced data quality and operational efficiency. My contributions have been key to delivering high-quality data science solutions that drive business excellence and fosterÂ innovation.

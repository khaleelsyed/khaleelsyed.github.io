In my role at ADSP, I have designed, constructed, tested, and maintained scalable data architectures, collaborating closely with senior engineers, data scientists, and data engineering teams. My work included identifying data acquisition opportunities, developing and integrating APIs, and creating internal tools to enhance workflow efficiency and support business requirements. Working in Python, I have leveraged technologies such as Django, FastAPI, and Prisma to develop robust data solutions.

Additionally, I have automated data workflows to ensure optimized performance and reliability. I have also implemented strategies to improve data quality and efficiency, thereby contributing to the successful delivery of high-quality data science solutions that drive business excellence.
